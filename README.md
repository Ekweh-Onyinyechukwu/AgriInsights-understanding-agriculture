## Produce Yields Dataset

## Overview

This analysis explores various aspects of agricultural produce yields using the provided dataset. The dataset contains information on produce yields with the following columns:

- **Area**: Geographical region where the data was collected.
- **Item**: Type of produce.
- **Year**: Year the data corresponds to.
- **hg/ha_yield**: Yield of produce in hectograms per hectare.
- **average_rain_fall_mm_per_year**: Average annual rainfall in millimeters.
- **pesticides_tonnes**: Amount of pesticides used in tonnes.
- **avg_temp**: Average temperature in degrees Celsius.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

1. Compare produce yields across different areas.
2. Examine the variation in produce yields over the years.
3. Investigate the correlation between average rainfall and produce yields.
4. Assess the impact of pesticide usage on produce yields.
5. Explore the relationship between average temperature and produce yields.
6. Identify the year with the highest overall produce yield.
7. Compare produce yields between different types of produce items.
8. Analyze the distribution of average rainfall across different areas.
9. Examine the trends in pesticide usage over the years.
10. Investigate the correlation between average temperature and pesticide usage.
